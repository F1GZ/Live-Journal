                <h3>Post 1: My greatest coding investment so far</h3>
                <p>I wanted to share the reasons why my raspbery pi workspace 
                is my best investment so far for my coding journey</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Seperate space</dt>
                    <dd>Having a seperate space is extremly good and helpful for 
                    keeping me productive as I now have a dedicated space compared 
                    to using my gaming pc with all it's distractions</dd>
                    <dt>Simplicity</dt>
                    <dd>As of right now I only have my monitor, keyboard, mouse, water, 
                    notebook, pens and plant pot on my desk. This greatly helps as it all 
                    isn't very stimulating and the desk itself is very small which stops me 
                    from puting anything else on it that may distract me</dd>
                    <dt>The computer's specs</dt>
                    <dd>Having a low speced computer is benificial as it stops me from playing 
                    too many games on it but is able to run all my code and web courses.</dd>
